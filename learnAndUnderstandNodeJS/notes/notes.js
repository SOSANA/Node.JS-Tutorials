/**
 * A JavaScript Engine:
 *  - a program that converts javascript code into something the computer
 *    processor can understand
 *  - follows the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and 
 *    what features it should have
 *  - ex: 
 *      - V8 (google), SpiderMonkey (Mozilla | MDN), and many more
 *      - ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines
 * 
 * Arguments:
 *  - values you give your program that affect how it runs
 *  - essentially passing parameters to a function
 * 
 * BreakPoint:
 *  - a spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution
 *    of our code so we can figure out what's going on
 * 
 * ECMAScript:
 *  - the standard javascript is based on
 *  - needed a standard since there are many engines
 * 
 * Command Line Interface (cli):
 *  - a utility to type commands to your computer rather than click
 *  - ex:
 *    - bash on linux
 *    - terminal on mac
 *    - command prompts on windows
 *  - ref: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
 * 
 * Machine Code (Language):
 *  - programming languages spoken by computer processors
 *  - every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled)
 *    into machine code
 *  - Node and V8 are written in C++, and is closer to the machine code
