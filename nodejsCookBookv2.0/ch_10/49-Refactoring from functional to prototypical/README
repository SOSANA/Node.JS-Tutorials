mp3dat: a rewrite of mp3dat from 45-Writing mp3dat using the prototype pattern. 

mp3dat_exposing_stat: an adjustment to mp3dat such that the stat method is included within
                      the returned instance so that it is visible to the module user

mp3dat_only_exposing_stat: a simpler adjustment to mp3dat that exposed ONLY the stat method, 
                           as in the functional style mp3dat of 45-Writing mp3dat

mp3dat_multiple_instances: an adjustment to mp3dat that allows the module user to initialize
                           multiple instances of mp3dat whilst still being able to reap the benefits
                           of shared state.
