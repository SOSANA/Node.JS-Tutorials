In this folder:

server.js - An HTTP server that deliberately crashes upon every HTTP request

crashingserver.conf - An Upstart script (to be placed in /etc/init) that keeps our server alive by
                      restarting it when it crashes, sending an email on every start. 

sitedownmon.conf - An Upstart script that monitors a fatal crash of our server, which is triggered
                   by exceeding the respawn limit set in crashingserver.conf. If a fatal crash is detected
                   it sends an email.
