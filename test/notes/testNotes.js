/**
 * assert:
 *  - compares one value to another
 *
 * Sinon:
 *  - Sinon helps eliminate complexity in tests by allowing you to easily create
 *    so called test-double.
 *    Test-doubles:
 *     - are, like the name suggests, replacements for pieces of code used in your
 *       tests. Taking this idea a little bit further. With Sinon, we can replace
 *       any JavaScript function with a test-double, which can then be configured
 *       to do a variety of things to make testing complex things simple.
 *  - Sinon splits test-doubles into three types:
 *    Spies:
 *     - which offer information about function calls, without affecting their behavior
 *    Stubs:
 *     - which are like spies, but completely replace the function. This makes it
 *       possible to make a stubbed function do whatever you like â€” throw an exception,
 *       return a specific value, etc
 *    Mocks:
 *     - which make replacing whole objects easier by combining both spies and stubs
 *
 * Mocha:
 *  - xit: having 'x' before 'it' causes mocha to ignore test
 *  - it.only: having '.only' causes mocha to ignore rest of test suite and only runs
 *    this test
