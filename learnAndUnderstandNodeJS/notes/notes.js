/**
 * A JavaScript Engine:
 *  - a program that converts javascript code into something the computer
 *    processor can understand
 *  - follows the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and
 *    what features it should have
 *  - ex:
 *      - V8 (google), SpiderMonkey (Mozilla | MDN), and many more
 *      - ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines
 *
 * Arguments:
 *  - values you give your program that affect how it runs
 *  - essentially passing parameters to a function
 *
 * BreakPoint:
 *  - a spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution
 *    of our code so we can figure out what's going on
 *  - ref: section4/D2_FirstClassFunctions & watch lecture 17
 *  	https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/#/lecture/3484570
 *
 * Command Line Interface (cli):
 *  - a utility to type commands to your computer rather than click
 *  - ex:
 *    - bash on linux
 *    - terminal on mac
 *    - command prompts on windows
 *  - ref: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
 *
 * CommonJS Modules:
 * 	- an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured
 *
 * ECMAScript:
 *  - the standard javascript is based on
 *  - needed a standard since there are many engines
 *
 * First-Class Functions:
 * 	- everything you can do with other types (strings, numbers, etc) you can
 * 		do with functions.
 * 	- you can use functions like strings, numbers, etc.
 * 	- ex:
 * 			- pass them around
 * 			- set variables equal to them
 * 			- put them in arrays and more
 * 	- ref: section4/D2_FirstClassFunctions
 *
 * Function Expressions:
 * 	- a block of code that results in a values
 * 	- are possible in javascript because functions are First-Class.
 * 	- ref: section4/D2_FirstClassFunctions
 *
 * Invoke:
 * 	- run the function
 * 	- we can also say 'call' the function
 *
 * Machine Code (Language):
 *  - programming languages spoken by computer processors
 *  - every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled)
 *    into machine code
 *  - Node and V8 are written in C++, and is closer to the machine code
 *  - ref: notes/levelOfAbstraction.png
 *
 * Module:
 * 	- a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact
 * 		other code. JavaScript didn't have this before
 *
 * Name/Value Pair:
 * 	- a name which maps to a value
 * 	- the name may be defined more than once,but only can have one value in
 * 		any given context
 * 	- that value may be more name/value paris
 * 	- ref: section4/D4_ObjectLiterals
 *
 * Object:
 * 	- a collection of name/value pairs
 * 	- the simplest definition when talking about javascript
 * 	- ref: section4/D4_ObjectLiterals
