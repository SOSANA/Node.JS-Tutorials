In this folder:

post-update: a Git Hook file which should be in the remote "bare" (skeletal) repository (repo) that mirrors the main repository (login)
             It should go into login/repo/hooks/

post-update-with-rebuild-and-install: As post-update but runs npm rebuild and npm install after an update to ensure all modules 
                                      are present and correct, irradicates need for node_modules folder to be synchronized,              
                                      
-.gitignore: When replaced in repo as .gitignore (i.e. without the dash prefix) it works in tandem with post-update-with-rebuild-and-install
             hook by ignoring the node_modules folder.

repo: A repository as cloned from the bare Git repository (repo) 
       that inherits from the initial login repository (login). Any changes pushed to this 
       repo trigger a post-update hook, which in turn triggers the login repository to 
       pull changes from repo and restart the app. 
       
repo_with_node_testing_integration_hook: As repo, but with the addition of a Node based pre-commit
                                         hook which forces testing on each commit, ensuring code
                                         quality. Files of note are package.json and .git/hooks/pre-commit
