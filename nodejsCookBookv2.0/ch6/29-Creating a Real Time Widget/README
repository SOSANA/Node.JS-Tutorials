server.js: a very basic HTTP server purely for the purpose of hosting index.html in order
           provide a hostname (localhost and 127.0.0.1) that can be tested against widget.js
           
index.html: very simple html file, that loads and initializes the real-time widget

widget.js: provides a live online counter for a website, emitting total connections to a site
           with the ability to serve multiple sites, also exposes the widget_client.js code
           concatenated with socket.io.js code for easy, customized script loading.

widget_client.js: client side Javascript, a modular widget that hooks up to the widget.js
                  socket.io server and recieves total counts for sites - is later read into
                  widget.js and concanated with socket.io.js, to be loaded as once script
                  into index.html

scalable_redis_widget.js: as widget_client.js but with improved memory storage for total 
                          counts in preparation to scale accross multiple servers
                          
watcher:
  server.js: copied and untouched from Recipe 2, Serving static files
  watcher.js: watches the content directory for changes, and then emits an update
              Socket.io event, which is picked up by the browser and causes a refresh.
              Directly provides the client side code to the browser.
